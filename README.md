Data Analysis and Exploration on Retail Transaction Data
In the dataset, you would have anonymised individual transactions data for our customers from Jan 19 to Sept 19. 
Please explore the data set, and answer the following questions:
 - What are the key customer segments?
 - Customers ceasing to transact is often an early indicator that they are moving to another provider or closing their business. 
    Suppose you are the analyst working with the customer retention team, how would you go about identifying such customers before they churn?
 - What would be your recommendations to retain these customers? How could the identification and retention of these customers be improved?
